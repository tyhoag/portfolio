## Background

Hello! My name is Ty Hoagland. Welcome to my PM portfolio. I am 22 years old and I am from Kaysville, Utah. I am a sophomore at Brigham Young University doing all of my prerequisite courses for the Marriott School of Business. I am a big sports fan and an even bigger fan of playing sports. Some of my favorites are Football, Lacrosse, Pickleball, Basketball, and rock climbing. I have a deep love for learning and for people. One of my mantras is that "there is something to be learned from everyone." Thanks for stopping by my portfolio and I hope it inspires you to keep building and creating!
