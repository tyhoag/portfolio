## Overview

Vocab+ is a micro-learning app that helps you learn new words and how to use them. It uses them in context, gives you a definition, and also allows you to see how people of the past would have used those words.

With so much information poured out upon us, we are losing sight of the beauty of learning things of value. Reading, writing, and learning how to speak eloquently and persuasively are lost skills and something we all need to develop. Vocab+ aims to bridge the gap between basic language knowledge and elevate users to more refined speech.
