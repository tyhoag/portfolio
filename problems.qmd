title: "Problems I'm Exploring"
---

As a product manager in training, I'm passionate about identifying real problems worth solving. Here are five challenges I've personally experienced and am actively exploring solutions for.

## 1. Lack of Integrated Support for Personal Fitness Transformation

**App Concept:** NOVIS

People who want to improve their fitness and overall wellbeing struggle to stay consistent because their workouts, nutrition, progress tracking, and motivation are spread across disconnected apps and platforms. This fragmentation makes it harder to build sustainable habits, measure real progress, and stay accountable over time.

**Why this matters to me:** I've personally experienced how difficult it is to maintain momentum when fitness resources feel disjointed and motivation relies on willpower rather than supportive systems.

## 2. Difficulty Creating Confident, Well-Coordinated Outfits

**App Concept:** AI Fashion App

Many people struggle to put together outfits they feel confident in because choosing clothing requires time, aesthetic judgment, and awareness of context such as weather or occasion. This often leads to frustration, decision fatigue, or reliance on the same few outfits while much of their wardrobe goes unused.

**Why this matters to me:** I've personally experienced how stressful getting dressed can feel when confidence and clarity are missing.

## 3. Limited Access to Everyday Cultural Experiences

**App Concept:** Culture Box

Many people are interested in learning about other cultures but are limited to surface-level exposure through social media, textbooks, or occasional travel. This makes it difficult to understand what daily life, traditions, and values actually feel like in another country.

**Why this matters to me:** I believe meaningful cultural exposure builds empathy and curiosity, and I've noticed how disconnected cultural learning can feel without tangible, real-world interaction.

## 4. Difficulty Maintaining Consistent Bedtimes

**App Concept:** Sleep App

Many people struggle to go to bed at the time they intend to, even when they understand the importance of sleep for health, focus, and performance. Distractions, poor routines, and lack of accountability often lead to late nights and inconsistent sleep schedules.

**Why this matters to me:** I've personally experienced how small nightly delays compound into fatigue and reduced productivity the next day.

## 5. Lack of Authentic, Low-Pressure Ways to Share Life with Friends

**App Concept:** Private Social/Vlog App

Many people want to stay meaningfully connected with close friends but feel that existing social media platforms encourage performance, comparison, and overexposure rather than genuine interaction. This pressure often discourages casual sharing and makes online connection feel draining or inauthentic.

**Why this matters to me:** I value real, everyday moments with friends and have experienced how difficult it is to share them in a space that feels both fun and safe.
